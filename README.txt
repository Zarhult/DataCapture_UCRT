Setting up environment:
1. BlackFly
Install the Spinnaker SDK for Python 3.10 using the link below:
https://www.teledynevisionsolutions.com/products/spinnaker-sdk/?model=Spinnaker%20SDK&vertical=machine%20vision&segment=iis

Install PySpin
PySpin is a wrapper for the Spinnaker library to allow you to code your application in python. Detailed installation instructions are in the README file. You can find this file after you double click on one of the PySpin installation files.

Choose the package that corresponds to your python version and Spinnaker version. For example, spinnaker_python-1.24.0.60-xxx.tar.gz represents PySpin version 1.24.0.60 and it is for python version 3.7.

Ensure that Python and the corresponding version of the Spinnaker SDK is installed before installing PySpin.

(Optional)
Run SpinView
SpinView is a GUI application that you can use to stream, save, or record images. You can also access or modify Spinnaker nodes to control the camera settings.
